## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In completing this project, I learned how to

- work with flex containers and flex items in Flexbox
- hide an element using CSS with `display: none;`
- add event listeners to elements using Javascript.

### Continued development

- In this project, the layout that I set up using Flexbox was straightforward. I'd like to learn to use Flexbox to set up more complicated layouts.
- Near completion of this project, I stumbled across the `box-sizing: border-box;` property-value pair in CSS. In the future, I think that I'll use this combination when specifying paddings and widths of elements. 

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css3_flexbox.asp) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
